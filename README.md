for the post endpoints, while testing in swagger:

create company:
- just add the string, id is assigned automatically (otherwise it will return 500)

create country
- just add the string, id is assigned automatically (otherwise it will return 500)


For the put endpoints:
- add the id in the response body, and change the desired string
